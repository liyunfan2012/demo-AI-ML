# AI & ML Demonstrations

This repository contains demonstrations of essential machine learning and deep learning algorithms, along with the underlying mathematics.  
Each folder focuses on a commonly used model, showing both theoretical foundations and practical implementations through Jupyter notebooks.



## Contents

- [ML_logistic_regression/](ML_logistic_regression/) â€” Logistic regression: math, a scikit-learn example, and a from-scratch NumPy + gradient-descent implementation.
- [ML_xgboost/](ML_xgboost/) â€” XGBoost: basics, preprocessing pipelines, gain/cover math, and a  poster with background + Python examples.
- [DL_FNN/](DL_FNN/) â€” Feedforward neural networks: forward pass math and a simple training demo.
- [DL_RNN/](DL_RNN/) â€” Recurrent neural networks: hidden-state updates and a sequence classification demo.
- [AI_GAN/](AI_GAN/) â€” Generative adversarial networks: generator vs. discriminator, minimax objective, and a toy training notebook.
